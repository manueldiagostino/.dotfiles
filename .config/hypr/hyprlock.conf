#*  Hyprlock Configuration File 
# Please do not edit this file manually.
# Follow the instructions below on how to make changes.


#* Hyprlock active layout path:
# Set the layout path to be used by Hyprlock.
# Check the available layouts in the './hyprlock/' directory.
# Example: /=/path/to/anurati
$LAYOUT_PATH=~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/theme.conf

#*  Persistent layout declaration 
# If a persistent layout path is declared in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hypr/hyde.conf,
# the above layout setting will be ignored.
# this should be the full path to the layout file.

#*  All boilerplate configurations are handled by HyDE 
source = ~/.local/share/hyde/hyprlock.conf

#*  Making a custom layout 
# To create a custom layout, make a file in the './hyprlock/' directory.
# Example: './hyprlock/your_custom.conf'
# To use the custom layout, set the following variable:
# $LAYOUT_PATH=your_custom
# The custom layout will be sourced automatically.
# Alternatively, you can statically source the layout in '~/.config/hypr/hyde.conf'.
# This will take precedence over the variable in '~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf'.


#*  Command Variables 
# Hyprlock ships with there default variables that can be used to customize the lock screen.
